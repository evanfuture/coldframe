#Coldframe

Coldframe is, as its metaphorical title implies, a frame in which to grow and nurture new websites.  With a few simple commands, you can be up and running a development environment on your machine that mirrors your production server.

Modelled off of [trellis], from the amazing team at [Roots], Coldframe is a less _thorough_ solution.  The framework is made for ease of use and tinkering, rather than for full best practice and security.  This integration will happen in the future, but we all have work to do in the present, so I’m making Coldframe available to start using now.
